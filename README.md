# cacheSystem
A simple LRU based cache system

This cache system contains the following 
1. It contains multiple levels and each level will contain a capacity 
2. It contains READ and WRITE time recorded. 
3. We dont use any persistent system. Everything is there in session. It is just to showcase how LRU can be implemented
